# Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods (Week 1)

## Introduction
Many people are starting to go vegan for a variety of reasons, whether it's to be healthier,
environmental issues or to embrace the cause of animals.This resulted, at first,
in the rise of plant products in supermarkets and then many vegan restaurants were born.

Despite the increasing number of people being attracted to the vegan diet
([5% of French people are vegetarians or vegans and 30% are flexitarians](https://www.vegactu.com/actualite/combien-de-vegetariens-et-de-vegans-en-france-25932/))
, few restaurants in France have been created to satisfy this new clientele.

This project aims to find the best possible location for an investor wishing to open a vegan
restaurant in the city of Nantes in France. Because despite being a niche sector, 
it is possible to make good profits if you have carefully studied the market 
and understood all the lifestyle behind the word _vegan_. Because the vegan diet is 
not only for vegans, it is also for the curious but also for those who use social networks,
in fact the _vegan diet_ is very popular on _Instagram_ especially through many celebrities
(Ariana Grande, Beyonc√©) who praise its merits. It will also be important to make 
future customers of the restaurant feel that they are going to enter in a healty atmosphere, 
by being close to healthy shops such as an organic grocery store for example.

This project will therefore aim to answer the question: "Where should an investor open a vegan restaurant in Nantes?" 

## Data
In order to be able to answer the above question, data on Nantes will be required, 
such as the longitude and latitude of each of its neighborhoods, 
its different restaurants and healthy places such as a yoga center.


## Methodology
- The data on the geographical coordinates will be collected on [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/quartiers-des-communes-de-nantes-metropole/) 
- Foursquare will be used to have the location of the different establishments that interest us 
- All the data will then be cleaned before grouping them in a dataframe.
- Finally, several python libraries will be used for datavizualization.
